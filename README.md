To run this code with the scanning feature, download all the code and use either npm or bun to create a local host of it on your computer. 
This might require you to download npm, bun, python, PDFPlumber, pip, and other software through your command line.


If you are okay without having the scanning feautre, you only need to download the zip file in the executableFile folder and extract it.
After that, simply run the app.exe from the extracted files!


Enjoy and please let me know how I can improve it or if you liked it!
